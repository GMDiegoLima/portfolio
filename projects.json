The main objective with this project was to consume the market data from the Albion Data Project, a open source project done by the albion online community, and create a graph visualization of the variation of prices, for the game items, in the discord and make it a profitable project using a subscription payment gateway (stripe).<br>This project was entirely done by myself using Python, to create the logo i used Canvas, to host the bot and the website i used Google CLoud Platform, for the website i used flask, html and css, to create the discord bot i used the discordpy library, to create the subscription system i used stripe as the payment gateway and for the data visualization i used matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn with the data from the Albion Data Project<br><br>I also used the python translators library to allow the users choose the language in which they want to see the data visualization result and mongodb to store the language preference of which discord server and the data of subscribers to show them on the koyn website.<br>You can check the Koyn website accessing https://koyn.online/ and know more about the koyn discord bot market data visualization project.",
